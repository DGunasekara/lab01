CO222 lab 01

 First task
 
      The first integer value represents a time of day on a 24 hour clock, so that 1245 represents quarter to
one mid-day.
  The second integer represents time duration in a similar way,so that 345 represents three hours and 45
minutes.This duration is to be added to the first time, and the result printed out in the same notation,
in this case 1630 which is the time 3 hours and 45 minutes after 12.45.
    
  Second task
  
     Second task for this lab is to write a program named quad.c which prompts the user to input
three coefficients a, b, c for a quadratic equation
                  ax 2 + bx + c = 0
This program compute the solution(s) to this equation, using the quadratic formula (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation), and print them.
